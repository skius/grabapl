# grabapl_syntax

A text-based frontend for [`grabapl`](https://crates.io/crates/grabapl) languages, supporting a Rust-like syntax with pluggable client-defined parsing rules
for operations and types.

See the main [`grabapl` documentation](https://crates.io/crates/grabapl) for an example program written in this syntax.

See the [documentation](https://docs.rs/grabapl_syntax/latest/grabapl_syntax/) of this crate for precise details on the
syntax and how to implement it for your own [`grabapl::Semantics`](https://docs.rs/grabapl/latest/grabapl/semantics/trait.Semantics.html) client.
