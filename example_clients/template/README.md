# Template for writing a grabapl semantics and client

TODO: extend this

TODO: can I have a subtrait of Semantics that has default implementations for everything that would make writing something new quite easy?
I don't think so. there's too many dependencies between types.

`semantics` is the Rust library containing the specific semantics of your language

`ffi` contains the bindings to other languages

`js` is autogenerated by build.sh

`web-demo` is a node js application that uses the built wasm and javascript bindings to actually run your semantics in a browser
